# VRify
VRify is a project that aims to allow android users to stream their phone applications into their Meta Quest VR headsets. This branch is for the mobile application, which receives input from a supported VR headset (input such as controller input, headsets are currently Meta Quest headsets), then it sends back graphical data to the headset.
